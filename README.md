# Professional README Generator

## Description
- As a developer, I wanted to create a README generator that would allow me to quickly build a high-quality README file from the command line interface
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Installation
User must install the 'inquirer' package by typing "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" into the CLI

## Usage
* Download/ clone the provided GitHub repository code
* Open the index.js file in your preferred text editor
* Open the integrated terminal while within the index.js file
* Run the command "node index.js" to initiate the program, respond to the prompts, and generate your README file


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
